The grammars of these tests are cached. Because of this, only one grammar can be used per directory, with only a single configuration. If multiple grammars or configurations are used, this will lead to unexpected results. Similarly, if dependencies update (besides the test file itself) the cached grammar won't update to reflect this. In this situation, the `outputs` directory can be removed to force regenerate the grammar

These tests aren't intended as classic unit tests, but instead serve as some level of validation for my approach. They have been created to generate results to include in the report.
